    <h4>1. What is the different between map, filter, foreach and find?</h4><br>
    <p> <span>Map:</span>  It creates a new array with the results of calling a provided function on every element in the array. The original array remains unchanged. It's useful for transforming data from one form to another.</p> <br>
    <p><span>Filter:</span> It creates a new array with all elements that pass the test implemented by the provided function. The original array remains unchanged. It's useful for selecting specific elements from an array.</p> <br>
    <p><span>ForEach:</span> It executes a provided function once for each array element. It doesn't return anything, and it doesn't modify the original array.</p><br>
    <p> <span>Find:</span> It returns the value of the first element in the array that satisfies the provided testing function. If no values satisfy the testing function, undefined is returned.</p> <br>

    <h4>2. What is the difference between Local storage, session storage and cookies?</h4> <br>
    <p><span>Local Storage:</span> Local storage is useful for storing data that the user will need to access later, such as offline data.</p> <br>
    <p><span>Session Storage:</span>  Session storage is a great way to improve the performance of your web applications.</p> <br>
    <p><span> Cookies:</span>Cookies are a good choice for storing data that should not be persisted for a long time, such as session IDs.</p> <br>

    <h4>3. What is Event Loop?</h4>
    <p>JavaScript has a runtime model based on an event loop, which is responsible for executing the code, collecting and processing events, and executing queued sub-tasks. This model is quite different from models in other languages like C and Java.</p> <br>

    <h4>4. how does quizTimer() work?</h4>
    <p>In JavaScript, a timer is created to execute a task or any function at a particular time. Basically, the timer is used to delay the execution of the program or to execute the JavaScript code in a regular time interval. With the help of timer, we can delay the execution of the code.</p> <br>

    <h4>5. how does chooseQuiz() work?</h4>
    <p>chooseQuiz() could be a function or method in any programming language, but its functionality would depend on how it was implemented within the program.</p>
